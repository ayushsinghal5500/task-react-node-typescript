Sure! Based on the project details you’ve shared earlier (React + TypeScript frontend, Node.js + Express backend, MongoDB, 2-level encryption for student login/registration CRUD), here’s a full README.md draft you can use:

# Student Management System

A full-stack web application for managing student data with secure authentication and 2-level encryption.

---

## 🔹 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**  
- React  
- TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS (optional, if used for styling)  
- React Hook Form + Zod (for form validation)  
- Lucide React Icons  

**Backend:**  
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- TypeScript  

**Database:**  
- MongoDB  

**Security / Encryption:**  
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for first-level encryption  
- Server-side additional encryption for sensitive fields (e.g., passwords)  

---

## 🔹 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
Setup Backend

cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Update .env with your MongoDB URI and encryption keys
npm run dev
Backend will start on http://localhost:5000

Setup Frontend

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Frontend will start on http://localhost:3000

Access the App

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000

Use the login or student registration forms to test CRUD operations

🔹 Encryption Implementation
This project implements 2-level encryption to secure sensitive data:

Frontend Encryption:

Before sending data to the server (like passwords), the frontend encrypts it using AES encryption.

This ensures data is never sent in plain text over the network.

Backend Encryption:

Server receives the already-encrypted data and applies an additional layer of encryption before saving it to MongoDB.

This ensures stored data remains secure even if the database is compromised.

Example Flow:

User Input (password) → AES encrypt (frontend) → Encrypted Payload sent to API → Backend applies additional encryption → Saved in DB
This dual-layer encryption provides enhanced security for sensitive user data.

🔹 Features
Student Registration and Login

CRUD operations for student data

Secure 2-level encryption for sensitive data

Form validation with Zod and React Hook Form

Modern and responsive UI

🔹 Environment Variables (.env)
Backend .env should include:

MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
FRONTEND_KEY=<frontend-encryption-key>
BACKEND_KEY=<backend-encryption-key>
Frontend .env (Vite) should include:

VITE_CLIENT_KEY=<frontend-encryption-key>
